# Employee-Retention-Analysis
Predictive analysis project utilizing the Pace strategy and a Linear Regression model for employee retention insights.

**Objective:**
The objective of this project is to analyze employee survey data from Salifort Motors to provide data-driven suggestions for improving employee retention. Specifically, we aim to build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of an employee leaving the company based on various factors such as department, number of projects, and average monthly hours.

**Strategy Used (PACE):**
We adopted the PACE strategy for this project:
- **Plan:** Understand the business scenario, clean and explore the data.
- **Analyze:** Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to analyze relationships between variables, identify patterns, and correlations.
- **Construct:** Determine the appropriate model, build the logistic regression model, and evaluate model assumptions.
- **Execute:** Interpret model results, share actionable insights with stakeholders, and propose recommendations.

**Tools Used:**
- Python programming language for data analysis and modeling.
- Pandas and NumPy libraries for data manipulation.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization and EDA.
- Scikit-learn library for building and evaluating the logistic regression model.

**Regression Model Used:**
We used logistic regression as the predictive model for this project. Logistic regression is suitable for binary classification tasks like predicting whether an employee will leave the company or not.

**Insights:**
1. Conducting thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) revealed significant relationships between employee attributes and turnover.
2. Capping the number of projects and promoting long-tenured employees can improve retention rates.
3. Providing rewards or clarifying policies around workload expectations can enhance job satisfaction.
4. Clear communication about company policies and addressing underlying cultural issues are crucial for employee retention.
5. Implementing fair evaluation practices based on effort rather than solely on hours worked can incentivize productivity and fairness.

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement policy changes based on insights obtained.
2. Engage employees through surveys or focus groups to gather feedback on proposed changes.
3. Provide training sessions and communication campaigns to ensure all employees are aware of policy changes.
4. Continuously monitor employee satisfaction and turnover rates to assess the effectiveness of policy changes and make adjustments as needed.

**Conclusion:**
This project provides valuable insights and recommendations for improving employee retention at Salifort Motors, contributing to a healthier work environment and increased employee satisfaction.
